# 🌟 SkyDash — 3D Obstacle Runner Game

## 📝 About the Game
**SkyDash** is a fast-paced 3D obstacle-runner and my first-ever game, fully created from scratch in Unity.  
It was developed as the **capstone project** for the **UNDP Game Development Bootcamp**, sponsored by the **Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation** and delivered in partnership with **HP**.

This project helped me learn gameplay mechanics, C# scripting, physics, animation workflows, UI, and WebGL publishing — all while exploring creativity and problem-solving.

## 🏁 Gameplay Overview
SkyDash challenges you to **reach the finish line without losing all your health**.  
You must avoid hazards and collect power coins that affect your movement, speed, and survivability.

Success requires quick reactions, timing, and careful health management.

---

## ⚠️ Hazards
These will stop you from reaching the goal:

- **Rotating Sweepers** – spinning obstacles that hit you and reduce health  
- **Black Coins** – harmful coins that drain health instantly  

---

## 💎 Power Coins
Each coin affects the player differently:

- **Green Coin** → Restores health  
- **Red Coin** → Grants a double jump  
- **Yellow Coin** → Gives a temporary speed boost  
- **Black Coin** → Reduces health (hazard)

---

## 🎯 Objective
Avoid hazards, collect helpful coins, keep your health up, and reach the finish line safely.
