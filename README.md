📝 About the Game
SkyDash is a fast-paced 3D obstacle-runner and my first-ever game, created from scratch in Unity as part of the UNDP Game Development Bootcamp sponsored by the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation and delivered in partnership with HP.
The game was built to practice real gameplay mechanics, physics, C# scripting, character animation, UI flow, and WebGL publishing — all while exploring creativity, design, and problem-solving.

🏁 Gameplay Overview
SkyDash is a fast-paced 3D runner where your main mission is clear:
✅ Reach the finish line without losing all your health.
To succeed, you must navigate the course while avoiding hazards and collecting helpful power coins. The challenge comes from balancing movement, timing, and health management as you react to obstacles in real time.

⚠️ Hazards
Rotating Sweepers — large spinning obstacles that hit you and reduce your health.
Black Coins — harmful coins that drain your health instantly (avoid them!).

💎 Power Coins
Green Coin: restores health
Red Coin: gives a double jump
Yellow Coin: speed boost
Black Coin: health loss (hazard)

🎯 Objective
Avoid hazards, collect helpful coins, keep your health up, and reach the finish line safely.

👩🏻‍💻 Developer Notes

SkyDash is my very first game, fully built and designed by Laila Abdulrahman.
It was developed as the capstone project for the UNDP Game Development Bootcamp, sponsored by the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation in partnership with HP.
This project represents the start of my game-development journey. I learned:

1. C# scripting
2. Basic game physics
3. Character movement
4. Animations
5. Level design
6. UI and menus
7. WebGL builds and publishing

I will continue updating this game with improvements, more levels, better visuals, and mobile-friendly controls!
